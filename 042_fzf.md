# fzf.vim

[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is a cli fuzzy finder tool.

You can use it from the shell and it is not specific to vim in any way.

However there is a very nice [fzf plugin for vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim)
which integrates fzf into standard vim functionality.

# What is fzf?

There's plenty of docs elsewhere for describing fzf.
A quick summary is that it's a general purpose fuzzy finder:

- standard input goes in one end (usually as lines)
- you interactively filter the lines by typing your search terms
- you select one option at the end

What generates the input and what uses the final selection is up to the thing using fzf.

It's a very useful tool on its own, even if you don't use it with vim.

# fzf.vim

The vim plugin uses fzf for searching through specific vim lists.

Some examples of the inputs and associated action are:

- filenames -> open that file
- lines within a file -> go to that line
- git commit messages -> inspect that commit in a buffer
- command history -> rerun that command
- search history -> rerun that search

# Old and new school

fzf.vim is very useful and it makes a lot of vim's search features mostly redundant.

fzf is relatively recent though (by vim standards) so a lot of vim resources will still point you towards
older approaches for things.

In my kata, I've put fzf _before_ the section on advanced search techniques because I feel that in most cases fzf is a faster
search tool for most situations.
There's still value in learning advanced search techniques, but it's less now.

# Exercises

You'll need fzf installed on your system and the vim plugin.

## Exercise 1 - opening a file

Let's open [kata 40](040_scripts.md).

Imagine we only knew that it had "scripts" somewhere in the name.

- do `:vsplit<enter>` (as we'll open it in a different split)
- do `:Files<enter>`
- type "scr" to narrow down the matches
- use `<c-p>` and `<c-n>` to move up and down the matches
- type "ipts" to further narrow down the results
- select `040_scripts.md`
- hit enter
- use `:q` to close the split

## Exercise 2 - finding some text

This exercise assumes you've got `rg` or `ag` installed.

They are both fast modern alternatives to `grep` which integrate well
with git and fzf.

If you haven't got either, I'd recommend installing [rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep),
and learning how to use it on the command line.

We'll use them to find the string "123456789" in our kata.

- do `:vsplit<enter>`
- do `:Rg<enter>` if you installed `rg`, or `:Ag<enter>` if you instaled `ag`
- start typing `123456789` to narrow down the matches
- use `<c-n>` and `<c-p>` to scroll through the matches
- select one and press enter
- use `:q` to close the split

The files searched will typically be everything in the current directory and deeper.

This is a very powerful and fast way to search for specific text in files.
The speed comes from the fact that tools like `rg` are very fast.

## Exercise 3 - searching your history

We can use `History:` to search our past ex commands.

- do `:History:<enter>`
- type `s/` to search for previous substitute operations
- use `<c-n>` and `<c-p>` to scroll through the matches
- hit enter to execute one

# Dig deeper yourself

The fzf.vim readme has a long list of built in commands you can run.

It's worth taking the time to look through them and play with them a bit.
Overall it's a really well made, simple plugin that is very powerful and will save you a lot of time.

# Summary

fzf on its own is a very useful tool, and when integrated into vim it will save you a lot of time
and save you having to learn some of vim's more obscure old school ways of doing things. 

Make sure it becomes part of your toolkit!
